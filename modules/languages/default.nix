# # Coding Languages
# This module'll probably see the most development soon.
# I use quite a few different programming languages, though primarily:
# - `python`
# - `rust`
# - `html` + `css` + `js`
# - `svelte`
#
# I might install `scala` because I like the language, but it probably
# won't see much usage in full-fat projects as I'm just more used to others.
