# Configuration Modules

This directory gives a library of reusable config modules<br/>\
that can be used to construct a full device configuration.<br/>\
For most of the modules here, a brief description of purpose<br/>\
can be found at the top of their respective `default.nix`.

As a general overview:

- `./applications`: various installed applications
- `./desktop`: desktop appearance and utilities
- `./editors`: code / text editors
- `./languages`: language support for my used languages
- `./nixos`: nixos system only modules
- `./terminal`: terminal theming and niceties
- `./utils`: nix utilities for configuration

> [!WARNING]
> Almost none of these modules use config\
> I may add config options later but for now
